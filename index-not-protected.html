The easiest way to get an IDP is to go to your nearest AAA. Please be careful on the windy country roads!</h5>

					<h2>Location Info</h2>
					<p>Fattoria Lavacchio is an incredible certified Organic Winery famous for their Chianti Rufina, sulfate free wines, and their homemade olive oils!</p>
					<p>The venue has 4 gorgeous villas nestled amongst the grape vines and olive trees - Casabella, Casanova, Monterifrassine, and Villa Mugnaio. Casabella is the main villa where breakfast is served each morning. It also has a restaurant that will be open during your stay, the pool and pool bar, and will be the location for most dinner events and activities (excluding the wedding and reception). Also on the property is a botega with an awesome sandwich shop and snacks/drinks, just across from the old windmill designed by Leonardo Da Vinci!</p>

							<h3>Rooms</h3>
							<p>We are happy to cover the cost of your room as a thank you for traveling all this way to celebrate with us! No need to make any reservations - we'll provide room assignments at a later date. Even if you can only make it for a couple days, we'd still love to see you and your room will be available the full time! Please let us know your expected arrival and departure dates once you have them so we can let the venue know when to have your room ready.</p>

							<h3>Food & Drinks</h3>
							<p>Your rooms include breakfast each day served at Casabella.  We are also covering costs for the the BBQ party on the 22nd, Pizza Party on the 23rd, food and drink for the wedding/reception on the 24th, and the pool party cocktails & apps on the 25th.</p>
							<p>For lunch each day and dinners for the first and last nights, you can visit the restaurant at Casabella or grab a sandwich at the botega down by the old mill. There's also a pool bar open at Casabella during the day. You are able to charge any additional food/drink costs to a credit card or to your room and settle up with Lavacchio at the end of your stay. </p>
							<p>Lavacchio is required by Italian Organic standards to only allow consumption of certified organic food and drink. Please refrain from consuming outside food or drinks in public areas. If you bring outside food/drink, just keep it within your own rooms.</p>

							<h3>Activities</h3>
							<p>Lavacchio is an AgriResort, offering some very cool activities for you to participate in. We'll do a group tour of the wine facilities on Friday night. During the day Friday, Saturday, or Monday, you can choose to take a cooking class, go truffle hunting, visit the old windmill, go horseback riding, take a ceramic class, get a massage, or just hang by the pool! We'll need to know which activities you are interested in advance to ensure availability with Lavacchio. The cost of these activities can be charged to your room - more info on activities can be found <a href="https://fattorialavacchio.com/en/agriresort-lifestyle/activities/" target="_blank">at this link.</a> </p>
							<p>These activities aren't required. If you'd prefer, you can take a car and explore Florence or the nearby towns of Rufina and Pontassieve during your free time instead.</p>

							<h3>Weather & Clothing</h3>
							<p>The most important thing to start with here is COMFY SHOES! Each building of Lavacchio is spaced out which is great for privacy, but can be a walk to get to Casabella for dinner or the botega for lunch. We'd rather you be comfy than fancy!</p>
							<p>Attire in general is relatively relaxed other than for the wedding and reception. </p>
							<p>For weather in general, in late May the highs are typically in the mid to upper 70s with the lows in the mid 50s. Typically this is the start to their dry season (knock on wood)!</p>
